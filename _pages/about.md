I am a final year PhD student in the Statistics department at UC Berkeley where I am advised by <a href='https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/'>Bin Yu</a> and <a href='https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/'>Song Mei</a>. I have also collaborated with <a href='http://misha.belkin-wang.org/'>Misha Belkin</a> at UC San Diego. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Caltech where I worked with <a href='http://www.yisongyue.com/'>Yisong Yue</a>.

I am broadly interested in developing a better foundational understanding of **deep learning** as well as improving real-world systems. Currently, I am particularly interested in questions related to model **scaling** and **efficiency**.

You can find my <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whE5b9M70bUoUkGCsLGUAJp6C_I790l2/view?usp=sharing'>CV</a> here.

**I am on the job market now and actively seeking full-time positions!**
